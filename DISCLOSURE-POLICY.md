## Purpose & Scope

WP Code Check is a static analysis tool that identifies potential security vulnerabilities, performance antipatterns, and code quality issues in WordPress plugins and themes. This policy governs how we disclose findings from our analysis of publicly available, GPL-licensed WordPress software distributed through WordPress.org and other public repositories.

**This policy applies to:**

- Automated static analysis reports generated by WP Code Check
- AI-assisted validation and classification of findings
- Public disclosure of potential issues in WordPress ecosystem software
- The WP Code Check Public Reports database

**This policy does not apply to:**

- Private scans performed by users on their own codebases
- Consulting engagements under separate agreement
- Vulnerability reports submitted to us by third parties

---

## Our Commitment

Hypercart and the WP Code Check project are committed to:

1. **Improving WordPress ecosystem security** — Our goal is to help developers write better, more secure code and to help site owners make informed decisions about the software they install.

2. **Responsible disclosure practices** — We provide plugin and theme authors reasonable time to address findings before public indexing.

3. **Accuracy and fairness** — We clearly distinguish between confirmed issues, likely issues, and potential concerns. We acknowledge the limitations of static analysis.

4. **Good faith engagement** — We welcome dialogue with developers and will update or correct reports when presented with new information.

5. **Transparency** — Our methodology, severity classifications, and detection patterns are documented and available for review.

---

## What We Publish

Our public reports include:

### Factual Information

- **Pattern detected:** The specific code pattern identified (e.g., `posts_per_page => -1`)
- **File location:** The file path and line number where the pattern appears
- **Code context:** A brief snippet showing the relevant code (typically 5-15 lines)
- **Detection rule:** The identifier of the rule that flagged the pattern (e.g., `unbounded-posts-per-page`)

### Our Analysis & Opinion

- **Severity assessment:** Our classification of the potential impact (Critical, High, Medium, Low)
- **Confidence level:** How certain our analysis is that this represents a genuine issue
- **Potential impact:** Our opinion on what could happen if the pattern is exploited or causes problems
- **Recommended remediation:** Our suggestions for addressing the finding
- **Mitigating factors:** Any factors we identified that reduce the severity or likelihood of impact

### Metadata

- **Plugin/theme name and version** analyzed
- **Scan date** and WP Code Check version used
- **Active install count** (from WordPress.org, if available)
- **Embargo status** and public indexing date

---

## What We Do Not Publish

We do not publish:

- **Working exploits** — We do not provide functional proof-of-concept code that could be directly used to attack sites
- **User data** — We never access, collect, or publish data from sites running analyzed plugins
- **Unverified claims** — Findings that fail our AI validation process are not published
- **Findings below our threshold** — Low-confidence findings are flagged for human review, not auto-published
- **Personally identifying information** — We do not publish developer personal information beyond what is already public on WordPress.org

---

## Disclosure Timeline

We follow a **45-day embargo model** aligned with industry responsible disclosure standards:

| Day | Action |
|-----|--------|
| **Day 0** | Scan completed. Report generated. Author notification sent (if contact available). Report published with `noindex` meta tag. |
| **Day 1-7** | Initial response window. We monitor for author acknowledgment. |
| **Day 7** | If no response, second notification attempt via alternative channels. |
| **Day 21** | Mid-embargo check. If author has responded and is actively working on a fix, we note this in the report. |
| **Day 40** | Final reminder sent to author. |
| **Day 45** | Embargo expires. `noindex` tag removed. Report eligible for search engine indexing. |

### Timeline Modifications

We may **extend** the embargo period if:

- The author demonstrates active, good-faith efforts to address the findings
- The finding is unusually complex and requires significant architectural changes
- Coordinated disclosure with other security researchers or platforms is warranted

We may **shorten** the embargo period if:

- Evidence suggests the finding is actively being exploited in the wild
- The author publicly discloses the finding themselves
- The finding is already publicly documented elsewhere

We will **not** delay disclosure:

- In exchange for payment or other consideration
- Due to threats of legal action
- Because the finding is embarrassing to the author

Final decisions regarding disclosure timing rest with Hypercart / Neochrome. Disclosure timelines may be adjusted to align with broader ecosystem safety considerations or platform-level guidance.

**We do not guarantee our performance as it relates to increases or delays to the disclosure timeline.** Timelines are provided as general guidance and reasonable-effort commitments, not contractual obligations. Authors should not rely on extensions being granted or on specific disclosure dates for planning purposes.

## Report Classification

### Severity Levels

| Level | Definition | Examples |
|-------|------------|----------|
| **Critical** | Findings that could directly lead to site compromise, data exposure, or complete loss of availability with minimal attacker effort. | SQL injection, authentication bypass, unbounded queries on high-traffic sites |
| **High** | Findings that could lead to significant security or performance impact under realistic conditions. | Missing capability checks, CSRF vulnerabilities, N+1 query patterns |
| **Medium** | Findings that represent security or performance concerns but require specific conditions or have limited impact. | Information disclosure, inefficient queries in admin contexts |
| **Low** | Findings that represent code quality issues or best practice violations with minimal direct security/performance impact. | Missing output escaping in low-risk contexts, suboptimal but bounded queries |

### Confidence Levels

| Level | Definition | Publication Status |
|-------|------------|-------------------|
| **Confirmed (80-100%)** | AI analysis confirms this is almost certainly a genuine issue with clear impact. | Published |
| **Likely (60-79%)** | AI analysis indicates this is probably a genuine issue, though some mitigating factors may exist. | Published with caveats |
| **Uncertain (40-59%)** | Cannot determine without additional context; mitigating factors may fully address the concern. | Routed to human review |
| **False Positive (0-39%)** | AI analysis indicates this is not a genuine issue due to mitigating factors, proper handling, or incorrect pattern match. | Not published |

### Risk Classification Terminology

Any references to *severity*, *impact*, or similar terminology are **informational risk heuristics only**. They are not equivalent to CVSS scores, CVE ratings, or authoritative vulnerability classifications.

Risk classifications are intended to help prioritize review and discussion and should not be interpreted as definitive security judgments or proof of exploitability.

---

## Liability Disclaimer and Nature of Findings

All findings, classifications, severity indicators, and reports published by WP Code Check are **opinions derived from automated, heuristic, and AI-assisted analysis** of source code. Findings may be incomplete, inaccurate, non-exploitable, or superseded by later information.

Reports are provided **"AS IS"**, without warranty of any kind, express or implied, including but not limited to accuracy, completeness, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, Hypercart / Neochrome disclaims all liability for any loss, damage, or harm arising from reliance on published reports, including reputational, economic, or operational impacts.

Publication of a report does not constitute an assertion of fact, a legal determination, or a claim of vulnerability, but rather a good-faith technical assessment intended to improve ecosystem security.

### Report Disclaimer

All WP Code Check public reports include the following disclaimer:

> **DISCLAIMER**
>
> This report is generated by automated static analysis tools with AI-assisted validation. Findings represent code patterns that *may* indicate security, performance, or code quality concerns based on WordPress development best practices.
>
> **This report constitutes our analysis and opinion** based on examination of publicly available, GPL-licensed source code. Static analysis cannot determine runtime behavior, evaluate all mitigating factors, or guarantee the presence or absence of security vulnerabilities.
>
> Findings are classified by severity and confidence level. Lower confidence findings may represent false positives. We encourage plugin authors to review findings and provide additional context.
>
> **This report is not:**
> - A guarantee of security or insecurity
> - A penetration test or dynamic analysis
> - Legal, compliance, or certification advice
> - An endorsement or condemnation of any product
>
> Users should conduct their own evaluation before making decisions based on this report. Hypercart and WP Code Check assume no liability for decisions made based on report contents.

### Static Analysis Limitations

Static analysis tools, including WP Code Check, have inherent limitations:

- **No runtime context** — We analyze code as written, not as executed. Runtime mitigations may exist that we cannot detect.
- **False positives** — Some patterns that match our rules may not be genuine issues in context.
- **False negatives** — We do not claim to find all issues. Absence of findings does not guarantee security.
- **Version-specific** — Our findings apply to the specific version analyzed. Earlier or later versions may differ.

### AI Analysis Limitations

Our AI-assisted validation improves accuracy but is not infallible:

- AI may miss mitigating factors in complex codebases
- AI confidence scores are probabilistic, not deterministic
- Novel coding patterns may be incorrectly classified

### Our Commitment to Accuracy

- We clearly state confidence levels on all findings
- We maintain a dispute process and respond to corrections
- We update reports when new information is provided
- We track and publish our false positive rates
- We continuously improve our detection rules based on feedback

---

## Author Notification Process

We make reasonable efforts to notify plugin and theme authors before the embargo period expires:

### Notification Channels (in order of preference)

1. **Security contact** — If the plugin has a documented security contact or vulnerability disclosure program (VDP)
2. **Plugin support email** — Contact information listed on WordPress.org
3. **Author website** — Security or contact page on the author's website
4. **WordPress.org support forum** — Private message if other channels fail

### Notification Content

Our notifications include:

- Summary of findings (severity and count)
- Link to the embargoed report (accessible but not indexed)
- Embargo expiration date
- Instructions for disputing findings or requesting an extension
- Our contact information for questions

### What We Do Not Do

- We do not demand payment to suppress or delay publication
- We do not offer to "sell" early access to findings
- We do not contact authors through social media or public channels for initial disclosure
- We do not threaten or coerce authors in any way

---

## Dispute Resolution

We believe in good-faith engagement and will consider all disputes seriously.

### How to Dispute a Finding

1. **Contact us** at the email listed in the report or at security@hypercart.com
2. **Provide specific information:**
   - Which finding(s) you are disputing
   - Why you believe the finding is inaccurate
   - Any mitigating factors we may have missed
   - Code references or documentation supporting your position

### Our Response

- **Acknowledgment** within 3 business days
- **Initial assessment** within 7 business days
- **Resolution** (update, removal, or explanation of why finding stands) within 14 business days

### Possible Outcomes

| Outcome | Action |
|---------|--------|
| **Finding removed** | We determined the finding was a false positive. Report updated, finding removed from public view. |
| **Severity adjusted** | We determined mitigating factors warrant a lower severity. Report updated with new classification. |
| **Finding confirmed** | We determined the finding is accurate as published. We will explain our reasoning. |
| **Finding updated** | We add additional context, mitigating factors, or author response to the report. |

### What We Will Not Do

- Remove accurate findings because they are embarrassing
- Remove findings in response to legal threats (though we will respond appropriately to valid legal process)
- Accept payment to remove or modify findings
- Engage in extended debate over matters of opinion (though we welcome factual corrections)

---

## Good-Faith Safe Harbor

Hypercart / Neochrome is committed to responsible, good-faith security research and disclosure.

We will not pursue legal action against developers, researchers, or users who:

- Engage constructively and in good faith regarding reported findings
- Refrain from harassment, threats, or knowingly false claims
- Do not misuse published information to cause harm

This policy is intended to encourage collaboration, remediation, and transparency—not punishment or adversarial conduct.

---

## Legal Basis

Our disclosure practices are grounded in established legal principles. This section summarizes the legal framework; it is not legal advice.

### First Amendment Protection

Publication of truthful information about matters of public concern is protected speech under the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. Security of widely-used software is a matter of significant public interest.

The Supreme Court has consistently held that the freedom to discuss matters of public concern lies at the foundation of free government. Software security directly affects millions of website owners and their visitors.

### Fair Comment & Opinion Privilege

Our reports clearly distinguish between:

- **Facts:** The code pattern exists at the specified location
- **Opinion:** Our assessment of the potential impact and severity

Under the fair comment doctrine, opinions based on disclosed, truthful facts are protected speech, even if the opinion is critical or ultimately incorrect. We state the factual basis for our opinions (the code we analyzed) and draw reasonable conclusions from those facts.

### GPL v2 License Terms

All plugins distributed through WordPress.org must be licensed under GPL v2 or later. The GPL explicitly grants rights to:

- **Access** the complete source code
- **Study** how the program works
- **Modify** the program
- **Distribute** copies and modifications

These freedoms are foundational to the GPL's purpose. The license exists specifically to ensure that source code can be examined, analyzed, and discussed publicly.

### No Trade Secret Protection for GPL Code

Trade secret protection requires that information be kept confidential through reasonable efforts. Code distributed publicly under the GPL cannot simultaneously be a protected trade secret—the author has affirmatively chosen to make the code public and granted explicit rights to study it.

### No Privacy Interest in Published Code

There is no recognized privacy interest in source code that has been:

- Voluntarily published to a public repository
- Licensed under terms that explicitly permit study and redistribution
- Made available for download by any member of the public

Authors who distribute code publicly cannot later claim that analysis of that code violates their privacy.

---

## For Plugin & Theme Developers

This section addresses common concerns from developers whose code appears in our reports.

### Understanding Your Rights

As the author of a WordPress plugin or theme, you have the right to:

- **Receive notification** of findings before public indexing (per our embargo process)
- **Dispute findings** you believe are inaccurate
- **Provide context** that may result in updated severity classifications
- **Request reasonable extensions** to the embargo period if you are actively addressing findings
- **Respond publicly** — we will include your response in the report if you wish

### Understanding Our Rights

Under established U.S. law, we have the right to:

- **Analyze publicly available GPL code** — The GPL explicitly grants this right to everyone
- **Publish our findings and opinions** — Protected by the First Amendment
- **Assess and classify severity** — Our opinion, based on disclosed facts, is protected speech
- **Maintain our publication timeline** — Responsible disclosure timelines are industry standard

### Common Misconceptions

#### "You can't publish information about my plugin without permission"

**Incorrect.** You published your source code publicly under the GPL, which explicitly grants rights to study and discuss the code. First Amendment protections apply to publication of truthful information about matters of public concern.

#### "This is defamation / libel"

**Unlikely.** Defamation requires false statements of fact. Our reports distinguish between facts (the code pattern exists) and opinions (our assessment of impact). Opinions based on disclosed, truthful facts are protected by the fair comment privilege, even if critical.

For a statement to be defamatory, it must be:

1. A false statement of fact (not opinion)
2. Published to third parties
3. Made with fault (negligence for private figures, actual malice for public figures)
4. Causing damage

Our factual statements are verifiable (the code either contains the pattern or it doesn't). Our opinions are clearly labeled as assessments based on those facts.

#### "My code is proprietary / private / confidential"

**Incorrect for WordPress.org plugins.** WordPress.org requires all plugins to be 100% GPL-compatible. The GPL is specifically designed to ensure code is *not* proprietary—that's its entire purpose.

If you wanted to keep your code private, the GPL was the wrong license to choose. You cannot retroactively claim privacy over code you publicly distributed under a license that guarantees the right to study and share it.

#### "You're violating my trade secrets"

**Incorrect.** Trade secret protection requires reasonable efforts to maintain secrecy. You cannot simultaneously:

- Publish code on a public repository
- License it under terms permitting study and redistribution
- Claim it as a protected trade secret

The act of public distribution destroys any trade secret claim.

#### "I'll sue you"

You are free to consult an attorney, and we recommend doing so before making legal threats. However, we note:

- **Threats do not change our timeline** — We will not suppress accurate findings due to threatened litigation
- **Frivolous lawsuits have consequences** — Courts may award fees and sanctions for baseless claims
- **Community response** — The security community has historically responded negatively to developers who threaten researchers. The Keeper Security case is instructive: after suing Ars Technica over vulnerability reporting, Keeper faced significant backlash and ultimately dropped the suit.
- **Streisand Effect** — Legal threats often draw more attention to findings than the original report

We engage in good faith with all disputes and will correct genuine errors. Legal threats are not an effective dispute resolution mechanism.

### Constructive Engagement

We genuinely want to help improve WordPress ecosystem security. Here's how to engage constructively:

1. **Review the finding carefully** — Understand exactly what was flagged and why
2. **Check for mitigating factors** — If your code handles the concern elsewhere, let us know with specific references
3. **Fix genuine issues** — The best response to an accurate finding is to ship a fix
4. **Request a re-scan** — After shipping a fix, we'll update the report to reflect the remediation
5. **Provide context** — If there are reasons the finding is less severe than assessed, we'll update the report
6. **Improve your process** — Consider adding static analysis to your own CI/CD pipeline
