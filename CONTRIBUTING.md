## 📝 Development Guidelines

### Adding New Performance Checks

All checks should follow this pattern:

```bash
# In dist/bin/check-performance.sh

run_check "ERROR|WARNING" "CRITICAL|HIGH|MEDIUM|LOW" \
  "Check name" "rule-id" \
  "-E pattern1" \
  "-E pattern2"
```

**Example:**
```bash
run_check "ERROR" "CRITICAL" \
  "Unbounded posts_per_page" "unbounded-posts-per-page" \
  "-E posts_per_page[[:space:]]*=>[[:space:]]*-1"
```

### Test Fixtures

Every new check **must** have test fixtures:

1. **Add antipattern** to `dist/tests/fixtures/antipatterns.php`
2. **Add safe pattern** to `dist/tests/fixtures/clean-code.php`
3. **Update expected counts** in `dist/tests/run-fixture-tests.sh`

### Code Style

- **Bash**: Follow [Google Shell Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/shellguide.html)
- **Comments**: Explain *why*, not *what*
- **Functions**: One responsibility per function
- **Variables**: Use descriptive names (`FINDING_COUNT` not `fc`)

## 🧪 Testing

### Run All Tests

```bash
cd dist/tests
./run-fixture-tests.sh
```

### Test Individual Checks

```bash
cd dist/bin
./check-performance.sh --paths ../tests/fixtures/antipatterns.php
```

Expected output:
- **Errors**: 6+ (depending on active checks)
- **Warnings**: 4+

### End-to-End Template Testing

Use the keyword **"Run template [name] end to end"** to execute a complete scan and AI triage workflow with minimal human intervention.

**What this does:**
1. Loads the template configuration from `TEMPLATES/[name].txt`
2. Executes the full performance scan (`check-performance.sh`)
3. Generates JSON log with all findings
4. Runs AI-assisted triage on the findings
5. Converts JSON to HTML report with triage data embedded
6. Opens the final report in your browser

**Example:**
```bash
# User request: "Run template gravityforms end to end"
# AI will execute:
./dist/bin/run gravityforms --format json
python3 dist/bin/ai-triage.py dist/logs/[latest].json
python3 dist/bin/json-to-html.py dist/logs/[latest].json dist/reports/[output].html
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Complete workflow in one command
- ✅ AI triage automatically classifies findings
- ✅ HTML report includes triage classifications and confidence levels
- ✅ No manual JSON/HTML conversion needed
- ✅ Ideal for testing new checks or validating fixes

**Template Requirements:**
- Template file must exist in `TEMPLATES/[name].txt`
- Must contain `PROJECT_PATH` pointing to a valid WordPress plugin/theme directory
- Optional: `FORMAT=json` to enable JSON output (required for triage)

## 📋 Commit Message Guidelines

Use conventional commits format:

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

**Types:**
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation only
- `test`: Adding/updating tests
- `refactor`: Code restructuring (no behavior change)
- `perf`: Performance improvement
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks

**Examples:**
```
feat(checks): add detection for unbounded get_users()

Detects get_users() calls without 'number' parameter which can
fetch ALL users and crash sites with large user bases.

Closes #42
```

```
fix(html): display full path instead of "." in report header

When scanning with --paths ., the HTML report now shows the
resolved absolute path instead of just a dot.
```
