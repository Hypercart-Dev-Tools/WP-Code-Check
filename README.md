# WP Code Check by Hypercart

**Fast, zero-dependency WordPress performance analyzer that catches critical issues before they crash your site.**

## Why WP Code Check?

WordPress sites fail in production because of **performance antipatterns** that slip through code review:

- 🔥 **Unbounded queries** (`posts_per_page => -1`) that fetch 50,000 posts and crash the server
- 🐌 **N+1 query patterns** that turn 1 request into 1,000 database calls
- 💥 **Missing capability checks** that let subscribers delete your entire site
- 🔐 **Insecure deserialization** that opens remote code execution vulnerabilities
- 🧲 **Debug code in production** (`var_dump`, `console.log`) that exposes sensitive data

**WP Code Check catches these issues in seconds** — before they reach production.

## What Makes It Different?

| Feature | WP Code Check | WPCS | PHPStan-WP |
|---------|---------------|------|------------|
| **Zero dependencies** | ✅ Bash + grep only | ❌ Requires PHP, Composer | ❌ Requires PHP, Composer |
| **Runs anywhere** | ✅ Local, CI/CD, any OS | ⚠️ PHP environment needed | ⚠️ PHP environment needed |
| **WordPress-specific** | ✅ WP performance focus | ⚠️ Generic PHP standards | ⚠️ Type safety focus |
| **Speed** | ✅ Scans 10K files in <5s | ⚠️ Slower on large codebases | ⚠️ Slower on large codebases |
| **Production-tested** | ✅ Real-world patterns | ✅ Industry standard | ✅ Type-focused |

## Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Hypercart-Dev-Tools/WP-Code-Check.git
cd WP-Code-Check

# Run against your WordPress plugin/theme
./dist/bin/check-performance.sh --paths /path/to/your/plugin
```

### Example Output

```
━━━ CRITICAL CHECKS (will fail build) ━━━

▸ Unbounded posts_per_page [CRITICAL]
  ✗ FAILED
  ./includes/query-helpers.php:45: 'posts_per_page' => -1

▸ Debug code in production [CRITICAL]
  ✗ FAILED
  ./admin/js/admin.js:293: debugger;

━━━ SUMMARY ━━━
  Errors:   2
  Warnings: 0

✗ Check failed with 2 error(s)
```

## Features

### 🔍 **30+ Performance & Security Checks**

- **Critical**: Unbounded queries, insecure deserialization, localStorage sensitive data, client-side serialization, **direct database queries without $wpdb->prepare()**
- **High**: Direct superglobal manipulation, **unsanitized superglobal read**, **admin functions without capability checks**, **WooCommerce N+1 patterns**, AJAX without nonce validation, unbounded SQL, expensive WP functions in polling
- **Medium**: N+1 patterns, transients without expiration, HTTP requests without timeout, unsafe RegExp construction, PHP short tags, **WooCommerce Subscriptions queries without limits**
- **Low**: Timezone-sensitive patterns

See [full check list](dist/README.md#what-it-detects).

### 📊 **Multiple Output Formats**

```bash
# Human-readable text (default)
./dist/bin/check-performance.sh --paths .

# JSON for CI/CD integration
./dist/bin/check-performance.sh --paths . --format json

# Auto-generated HTML reports
# Opens in browser automatically (local development)
```

### 🎯 **Baseline Support**

Manage technical debt in legacy codebases:

```bash
# Generate baseline from current state
./dist/bin/check-performance.sh --paths . --generate-baseline

# Future scans only report NEW issues
./dist/bin/check-performance.sh --paths .
```

### 📝 **Project Templates**

Save scan configurations for frequently-checked projects:

```bash
# Create template
./dist/bin/run my-plugin

# Reuse template
./dist/bin/run my-plugin
```

See [HOWTO-TEMPLATES.md](dist/HOWTO-TEMPLATES.md) for details.
