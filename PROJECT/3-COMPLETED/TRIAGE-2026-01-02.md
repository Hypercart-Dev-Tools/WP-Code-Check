# PROJECT Inbox Triage – 2026-01-02

**Created:** 2026-01-02  
**Status:** In Progress  
**Purpose:** Summarize recommended actions for each `PROJECT/1-INBOX` document so the maintainer can review and decide, one by one.

---

## 1. CONSOLIDATION-COMPLETE.md

**File:** `PROJECT/1-INBOX/CONSOLIDATION-COMPLETE.md`  
**Type:** Update log for logic-duplication spec

### Observation
- States that `LOGIC-DUPLICATION-UPDATES.md` has been merged into `PROJECT-LOGIC-DUPLICATION.md`.
- Status inside file already says consolidation is **complete**.
- `LOGIC-DUPLICATION-UPDATES.md` currently lives in `PROJECT/3-COMPLETED/` (summary of changes).

### Recommended Changes
- Treat as a **completed documentation update**, not an active task.
- Add/confirm frontmatter:
  - `Status: Completed`
  - `Completed: 2026-01-01` (or actual date)
- **Move:** `CONSOLIDATION-COMPLETE.md` → `PROJECT/3-COMPLETED/`.

### Questions for You
1. Do you want to keep this as a separate “update log” file, or fold its contents into the bottom of `PROJECT-LOGIC-DUPLICATION.md` under a "Document History" section and then archive/delete it?

---

## 2. DRY-POC-SUMMARY.md

**File:** `PROJECT/1-INBOX/DRY-POC-SUMMARY.md`  
**Type:** Proof-of-concept summary for Magic String Detector (DRY)

### Observation
- Status line: `Planning Complete – Ready for Implementation`.
- Describes:
  - Planning doc: `NEXT-FIND-DRY.md`.
  - 3 DRY JSON patterns under `dist/patterns/dry/`.
  - `dist/patterns/dry/README.md` for documentation.
- Lists remaining work: fixtures + aggregation wiring.
- Codebase already contains DRY patterns/docs; there are also fixture-related reports in `PROJECT/3-COMPLETED/`.

### Recommended Changes
- Treat this as a **completed POC planning+design summary**, not an active task.
- Update status block to:
  - `Status: Completed`
  - Add a small **“Implementation Outcome”** subsection linking to:
    - `dist/patterns/dry/` JSONs
    - `dist/patterns/dry/README.md`
    - Any relevant `TEST_FIXTURES_*` docs if they cover DRY
- **Move:** `DRY-POC-SUMMARY.md` → `PROJECT/3-COMPLETED/`.

### Questions for You
1. Is Phase 1 DRY (3 patterns + fixtures + aggregation) effectively shipped, or are fixtures/aggregation still partially TODO?
2. Should we add a short "Shipped In" version tag here (e.g., `Shipped In: v1.0.xx`)?

---

## 3. FIND-DRY.md

**File:** `PROJECT/1-INBOX/FIND-DRY.md`  
**Type:** Generic DRY + architecture checker specification (repo-agnostic)

### Observation
- Large, general spec for a grep-first DRY/architecture checker.
- Not specific to wp-code-check; more of a background design document.
- You now have wp-code-check–specific DRY plan in `NEXT-FIND-DRY.md` and POC summary in `DRY-POC-SUMMARY.md`.

### Recommended Changes
- Reclassify as **reference/spec**, not an INBOX task.
- Add a short header note:
  - `Status: Reference`
  - `Note: Background spec informing NEXT-FIND-DRY.md and DRY implementation.`
- **Move:** `FIND-DRY.md` → `PROJECT/FIND-DRY.md` (root-level reference).

### Questions for You
1. Do you still actively iterate on this generic spec, or is it stable reference now?
2. Do you want this re-titled to something like `PROJECT-DRY-ARCH-SPEC.md`, or keep the existing filename for now?

---

## 4. GITHUB-ADD-ISSUE.md

**File:** `PROJECT/1-INBOX/GITHUB-ADD-ISSUE.md`  
**Type:** Raw research note / web-scraped style answer

### Observation
- Describes third-party browser extensions for quickly creating GitHub issues.
- No task framing (no status, acceptance criteria, or link to wp-code-check roadmap).
- Looks more like an ad-hoc research answer than a concrete project task.

### Recommended Changes
Two options depending on whether you care about this item:

**Option A – Archive as Cancelled**
- Add frontmatter:
  - `Status: Cancelled`
  - `Cancelled Reason: Out of scope for wp-code-check core roadmap (developer tooling only).`
- **Move:** `GITHUB-ADD-ISSUE.md` → `PROJECT/3-COMPLETED/` as an archived research note.

**Option B – Keep as Deferred Idea**
- Add frontmatter:
  - `Status: Deferred`
  - `Deferred Until: After v1.x baseline + DRY work`
  - `Deferred Reason: Nice-to-have productivity tool, not core functionality.`
- Keep in `1-INBOX/` but clearly marked as deferred.

### Questions for You
1. Is "quick GitHub issue creation" something you realistically want to pursue as part of this repo, or should we mark it Cancelled and archive it?

---

## 5. NEW-PATTERN-OPPORTUNITIES.md

**File:** `PROJECT/1-INBOX/NEW-PATTERN-OPPORTUNITIES.md`  
**Type:** Pattern ideas from Woo All Products for Subscriptions audit

### Observation
- Lists 8+ pattern ideas with details (severity, rule IDs, proposed grep expressions).
- Some entries already marked as COMPLETE or ENHANCED (e.g., unsanitized `$_GET`, admin capability checks).
- Mix of:
  - Implemented patterns
  - Pending ideas
  - Future possibilities

### Recommended Changes
- Convert into a **pattern backlog / idea bank**, not an INBOX task.
- Add a top-level **Status Summary** section grouping patterns into:
  - Implemented (with version numbers)
  - Pending / To Evaluate
  - Rejected / Low ROI
- Add frontmatter:
  - `Status: Reference`
  - `Purpose: Backlog of potential detection rules derived from IRL audits.`
- **Move:** `NEW-PATTERN-OPPORTUNITIES.md` → `PROJECT/NEW-PATTERN-OPPORTUNITIES.md` (root-level reference).

### Questions for You
1. Do you want to keep treating this as a living idea bank, updated as patterns ship, or should we snapshot it and spin off a smaller "NEXT-PATTERNS" task doc for near-term work?

---

## 6. NEXT-BASELINE-ISSUE.md

**File:** `PROJECT/1-INBOX/NEXT-BASELINE-ISSUE.md`  
**Type:** Support-style explanation of baseline behavior for a specific plugin

### Observation
- Reads like a conversation transcript explaining baseline behavior (69 baselined findings, 0 new).
- Clarifies that behavior is correct but UX could be clearer.
- Not structured as a spec (no acceptance criteria or implementation plan).

### Recommended Changes
If you want to preserve it:
- Add frontmatter:
  - `Status: Completed`
  - `Type: Support Explanation / UX Note`
- Add short summary section:
  - "Key UX Observations & Potential Improvements" (2–3 bullets).
- **Move:** `NEXT-BASELINE-ISSUE.md` → `PROJECT/3-COMPLETED/`.

If you don't need it:
- Mark `Status: Cancelled` and archive in `3-COMPLETED/` (or delete).

### Questions for You
1. Would you like this turned into a more formal "Baseline UX / FAQ" entry under `PROJECT/` (e.g., `BASELINE-BEHAVIOR-FAQ.md`), or is the existing explanation enough and can be archived as-is?

---

## 7. NEXT-CALIBRATION.md

**File:** `PROJECT/1-INBOX/NEXT-CALIBRATION.md`  
**Type:** Calibration plan (false-positive reduction roadmap)

### Observation
- Status: `In Progress` (already in the file).
- Phase 1 priorities 1–3.5 marked as COMPLETED.
- Phase 2 / 3 tasks still open.
- Multiple COMPLETED docs in `3-COMPLETED/` directly relate (fixtures eval, severity overrides, test fixtures reports).

### Recommended Changes
- This is an **active working document**.
- Keep as the primary calibration tracker.
- Update/confirm metadata:
  - `Status: In Progress`
  - Possibly `Assigned Version:` if you want a target.
- **Move:** `NEXT-CALIBRATION.md` → `PROJECT/2-WORKING/NEXT-CALIBRATION.md`.

### Questions for You
1. Do you want to split out finished Phase 1 into a separate `CALIBRATION-PHASE-1-COMPLETED.md` summary, leaving this file only for future work (Phase 2/3)?

---

## 8. NEXT-FIND-DRY.md

**File:** `PROJECT/1-INBOX/NEXT-FIND-DRY.md`  
**Type:** WP Code Check–specific DRY implementation plan

### Observation
- Status: `Planning`.
- Concrete 3-phase plan reusing existing pattern infrastructure.
- `DRY-POC-SUMMARY.md` shows Phase 1 planning and pattern creation are done.

### Recommended Changes
- Treat this as a **completed planning spec** backing the DRY POC.
- Add metadata:
  - `Status: Completed (Phase 1 Planning)`
  - Optional: `Linked Summary: DRY-POC-SUMMARY.md`
- **Move:** `NEXT-FIND-DRY.md` → `PROJECT/NEXT-FIND-DRY.md` (root-level reference for DRY work).

### Questions for You
1. Do you want to keep Phases 2–3 in this same file, or spin them into a new `NEXT-DRY-EXPANSION.md` so this doc reflects "what we planned for Phase 1" only?

---

## 9. PROJECT-LOGIC-DUPLICATION.md

**File:** `PROJECT/1-INBOX/PROJECT-LOGIC-DUPLICATION.md`  
**Type:** Canonical spec for logic clone detection (grep+aggregation)

### Observation
- `LOGIC-DUPLICATION-UPDATES.md` (already in `3-COMPLETED/`) claims this doc has been updated with:
  - Real-world context
  - Adjusted timelines
  - Go/No-Go criteria
  - JSON schema example
  - Lessons learned from v1.0.73
  - Integration checklist & WP-specific patterns
- Implementation itself (duplicate-functions pattern, fixtures, wiring) is **not yet obviously present** from the high-level repo listing.

### Recommended Changes
Two paths, depending on your intent:

**Option A – Treat as Ready-to-Start Implementation**
- Add frontmatter:
  - `Status: Not Started`
  - `Priority: HIGH`
- Keep in `1-INBOX/` for now as "next candidate big feature".
- Add a small "Next Actions" list pointing to the concrete files from the integration checklist.

**Option B – Move to Active Work**
- If you intend to start implementation soon:
  - Set `Status: In Progress`.
  - **Move:** `PROJECT-LOGIC-DUPLICATION.md` → `PROJECT/2-WORKING/`.

### Questions for You
1. Is logic-clone detection something you want to start in the current milestone (then we move it to `2-WORKING`), or should it remain a high-priority backlog item in `1-INBOX`?

---

## 10. LOGIC-DUPLICATION-UPDATES.md (Context Check)

**File:** `PROJECT/3-COMPLETED/LOGIC-DUPLICATION-UPDATES.md`  
**Type:** Summary of updates applied to `PROJECT-LOGIC-DUPLICATION.md`

### Observation
- Already in `3-COMPLETED/`.
- Describes how the feasibility study was updated to align with proven v1.0.73 architecture.

### Recommended Changes
- No folder move needed (already COMPLETED).
- Optional: Add at top:
  - `Status: Completed`
  - `Linked Spec: PROJECT-LOGIC-DUPLICATION.md`.

### Questions for You
1. Do you want `CONSOLIDATION-COMPLETE.md` and `LOGIC-DUPLICATION-UPDATES.md` eventually merged into a single "Document History" section inside `PROJECT-LOGIC-DUPLICATION.md`?

## Next Steps Checklist (For You)

You can now go through each item and decide:

- [ ] **CONSOLIDATION-COMPLETE.md** – Archive to COMPLETED? Merge into spec?
- [ ] **DRY-POC-SUMMARY.md** – Mark Completed + move to COMPLETED?
- [ ] **FIND-DRY.md** – Move to PROJECT root as reference?
- [ ] **GITHUB-ADD-ISSUE.md** – Cancel & archive, or defer?
- [ ] **NEW-PATTERN-OPPORTUNITIES.md** – Convert to pattern backlog and move to PROJECT root?
- [ ] **NEXT-BASELINE-ISSUE.md** – Archive as support note or convert to FAQ?
- [ ] **NEXT-CALIBRATION.md** – Move to 2-WORKING as active calibration driver?
- [ ] **NEXT-FIND-DRY.md** – Mark Phase 1 planning completed and move to PROJECT root?
- [ ] **PROJECT-LOGIC-DUPLICATION.md** – Keep as backlog or promote to 2-WORKING?

If you confirm your decisions on each bullet, I can apply the moves, add the frontmatter changes, and keep everything consistent with the `AGENTS.md` workflow rules.
