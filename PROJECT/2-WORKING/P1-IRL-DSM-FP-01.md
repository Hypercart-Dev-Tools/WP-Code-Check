## Project Summary

Reduce DSM false positives by ~5–20% while keeping the rule loud on genuine risk. The win is lowering scan failures and manual triage caused by guarded/sanitized patterns, without weakening security. This is realistic without a full AST: do a severity split in the quick scanner first, then optionally use the Golden Rules Analyzer (GRA) as a second-pass filter for edge cases.

## Phased Checklist (Track Progress Here)

Note for LLM: Always mark checklist items as progress is made.

V1.x Series
- [x] Phase 1: Define policy and heuristics (guarded vs unguarded DSM)
- [ ] Phase 2: Implement quick scanner refinements
- [x] Phase 3: Benchmark results on representative plugins
- [ ] Decision Gate A: After benchmarks, decide if GRA prototype is required
- [ ] Phase 4: Prototype GRA SuperglobalsRule (optional)
- [ ] Phase 5: Decide on integration strategy and rollout

## Problem Statement

Real-world scans (e.g., Gravity Forms, WooCommerce add-ons) show the `spo-002-superglobals` rule is directionally correct but still produces roughly 5–20% false positives:

- Lines are flagged even when nonce checks and sanitization are present.
- Some flags are on bridge code or legacy patterns that are effectively acceptable risk.
- A few flags are contextually safe (e.g., admin-only, guarded, sanitized), but still fail the check.

We want to avoid turning DSM into a purely informational rule; it should still fail when:

- Superglobals are written or modified without guards, or
- Flow makes it difficult to reason about data provenance.

## Current Behavior (Quick Scanner)

The quick scanner implements DSM in `dist/bin/check-performance.sh` roughly as:

- Grep for superglobal writes/manipulation:
  - `unset($_GET/$_POST/$_REQUEST/$_COOKIE['...'])`
  - `$_GET/$_POST/$_REQUEST = ...`
  - `$_GET/$_POST/$_REQUEST/$_COOKIE['...'] = ...`
- Skip obvious comment lines and patterns that look like HTML/REST config.
- Look for security guards near the match using `detect_guards()`.
  - Examples: `check_admin_referer`, `wp_verify_nonce`, capability checks.
- Honor `should_suppress_finding` for per-file/project ignores.
- Record `guards` in the JSON finding and downgrade severity when guards exist, but still:
  - Mark the check as failed when any DSM instance is found.
  - Emit findings as `error` severity in JSON (with adjusted impact).

This keeps DSM highly visible but means guarded + sanitized DSM still contributes to failures and manual triage load.

## Observed False Positive Patterns

From real plugin scans (e.g., Gravity Forms, Hypercart Server Monitor MKII):

1. Nonce + capability guarded form handlers
   - Typical pattern:
     - `check_admin_referer()` and sometimes `current_user_can()` before touching `$_POST`.
     - Immediate sanitization via `absint`, `sanitize_text_field`, `sanitize_email`, `sanitize_key`, etc.
   - These are expected WordPress form-handling patterns.

2. Bridge or transport code
   - Code that moves values between `$_POST`, `$_REQUEST`, or internal arrays to satisfy older APIs.
   - Risk is lower when values are already sanitized or re-validated at the actual sink.

3. Project-specific wrappers
   - Helpers like `rgpost()`, `rgget()`, or framework-specific accessors that centralize sanitization.
   - DSM flags assignments around these wrappers even when the overall pattern is considered safe by project conventions.

4. Admin-only flows
   - DSM in code that only runs on `is_admin()` routes with additional capability checks.
   - Still worth surfacing but should not carry the same severity as public endpoint manipulations.

5. JS/AJAX requests inside PHP views
   - Patterns like jQuery `$.ajax({ type: 'POST', data: { action: '...' } })` embedded in PHP admin views.
   - These are front-end request descriptors (JavaScript), not PHP superglobal writes, but can currently be misclassified as DSM.
   - Concrete example: Hypercart Server Monitor MKII admin tabs (`tab-manual-test.php`, `tab-email.php`, `tab-debug.php`) where `type: 'POST'` lines are flagged by `spo-002-superglobals`.

## Goals and Success Metrics

- Reduce DSM false positives by ~5–20% without reducing detection of unguarded writes.
- Decrease scan failures caused by guarded/sanitized patterns.
- Preserve visibility by keeping guarded DSM findings in output (lower severity).

## Plan of Record

Primary path (recommended):

1. Refine heuristics in the quick scanner (no AST) to split severity and failure criteria.
2. Benchmark the impact on a small, representative plugin set.
3. If still noisy, add an optional GRA SuperglobalsRule for second-pass filtering.

## Implementation Details

### Phase 1: Define Policy and Heuristics

- Split DSM into two categories at the check level:
  - Unguarded DSM: fails the check.
  - Guarded DSM: recorded as warning/info, does not fail the check.
- Add sanitizer detection for writes:
  - If a context window contains both guard and sanitizer, downgrade further.
- Strengthen non-PHP filtering (make JS/AJAX-in-PHP a first-class case):
  - Tighten `is_html_or_rest_config` (or equivalent helper) so DSM ignores JS snippets and REST config lines entirely.
  - Explicitly treat jQuery/JS AJAX blocks inside PHP views (e.g., `$.ajax({ type: 'POST', data: { action: 'hsm_*' } })`) as **out of scope for DSM**; they should instead be handled by JS-facing rules.
- Add project-level allowlist pattern:
  - Allow per-project suppression of known bridge code, e.g., `spo-002-superglobals-bridge`.

#### Phase 1 Output: Defined Policies and Decisions

1. Severity and failure criteria
   - Fail the DSM check only when a finding is classified as unguarded.
   - Guarded DSM remains visible in output but does not fail the scan.
   - Guarded + sanitized DSM is downgraded further (info-level).

2. Guard definitions (minimum viable)
   - Nonce verification: `check_admin_referer`, `wp_verify_nonce`.
   - Capability checks: `current_user_can`.
   - Admin gating: `is_admin` counts only as a weak guard (does not fail by itself).

3. Sanitizer detection (writes only)
   - Recognize `absint`, `sanitize_text_field`, `sanitize_email`, `sanitize_key`, `esc_url_raw`, `sanitize_textarea_field`.
   - Sanitizer must wrap the superglobal assignment or appear within the same context window as the write.

4. JS/AJAX-in-PHP exclusion policy
   - Lines inside JavaScript blocks in PHP views are out of scope for DSM.
   - jQuery patterns like `$.ajax({ type: 'POST', data: { ... } })` are excluded from DSM.
   - These should be handled by JS-facing rules instead of DSM.

5. Bridge code allowlist
   - Add per-project suppression pattern `spo-002-superglobals-bridge`.
   - Bridge suppressions are allowed only in explicitly listed files.

6. Context window
   - Guard and sanitizer detection uses a small surrounding window (current line plus nearby lines).
   - Window size should be consistent with existing guard detection to avoid surprising behavior.

### Phase 2: Implement Quick Scanner Refinements

- Update `detect_guards()` and add `detect_sanitizers()`.
- Adjust DSM check failure logic to trigger only on unguarded DSM.
- Update JSON output to include `guarded`, `sanitized`, and `severity` fields as appropriate.

#### Phase 2 Implementation Tasks (Concrete)

- [x] Guard detection updates
  - [x] Ensure `detect_guards()` recognizes `check_admin_referer`, `wp_verify_nonce`, and `current_user_can`.
  - [x] Treat `is_admin` as a weak guard only (does not fully downgrade on its own).
  - [x] Include same-line guard checks (e.g., `wp_verify_nonce` in the condition).

- [x] Sanitizer detection for writes
  - [x] Add `detect_write_sanitizers()` with the Phase 1 sanitizer list.
  - [x] Limit sanitizer signals to the same context window as the write.

- [x] DSM classification and failure criteria
  - [x] Compute `guarded` and `sanitized` booleans per finding.
  - [x] Fail the check only when `guarded=false`.
  - [x] Downgrade guarded + sanitized to info severity.

- [x] JS/AJAX-in-PHP exclusion
  - [x] Tighten `is_html_or_rest_config` (or add a dedicated JS detector).
  - [x] Exclude lines inside JS blocks in PHP views, especially `$.ajax({ type: 'POST' ... })`.

- [ ] Bridge code allowlist
  - [x] Extend `should_suppress_finding` to support `spo-002-superglobals-bridge`.
  - [ ] Document expected format in template suppression examples if needed.

- [x] Output consistency
  - [x] Confirm JSON findings include `guards` list and new `guarded/sanitized/severity` fields.

### Phase 3: Benchmark Results

- Use 3 to 5 representative plugins (e.g., Gravity Forms, WooCommerce extensions, Hypercart Server Monitor MKII).
- Measure:
  - DSM finding counts before vs after changes.
  - Share of findings now classified as guarded/sanitized.
  - Any missed unguarded DSM instances.
  - Specific regression: Hypercart Server Monitor MKII should report **zero** DSM findings originating from JS admin views once non-PHP filtering is in place.

#### Benchmark Results (Current)

1. Hypercart Server Monitor MKII
   - Result: DSM findings = 0 (no failures).
   - Regression target met: JS admin view DSM findings removed.

2. Health Check & Troubleshooting
   - Before: DSM total = 8.
   - After: DSM total = 8; unguarded (fail) = 3.
   - Net: Reduced failing DSM count by 5 while preserving visibility.

3. SPC Order Velocity Monitor (Scaled)
   - Before (2026-01-10-012836-UTC.json): DSM total = 16.
   - After (2026-01-17-225644-UTC.json): DSM total = 18; unguarded (fail) = 9; guarded/info = 9.
   - Net: Failing DSM count reduced by 7, with additional guarded/info visibility.

### Phase 4 (Optional): GRA SuperglobalsRule

- Add `SuperglobalsRule` to `dist/bin/experimental/golden-rules-analyzer.php`.
- Classify occurrences as error, warning, info based on guards and sanitizers.
- Add CLI option `--rule=superglobals` and JSON output for integration.

### Phase 5: Integration and Rollout

- Decide whether GRA integration is:
  - Default for DSM, or
  - Opt-in via `--enable-golden-rules-dsm` or project config.
- Document the policy in README or scanner docs if needed.

## Risks and Mitigations

- Risk: Guard detection misses edge cases and allows risky writes.
  - Mitigation: Keep unguarded detection strict; do not suppress without explicit guard + sanitizer.
- Risk: Added heuristics become inconsistent across projects.
  - Mitigation: Use project-level allowlists and document how to configure them.
- Risk: GRA integration increases runtime cost.
  - Mitigation: Make it opt-in or only run when DSM hits exist.

## Test Fixtures (Not Started)

Goal: Validate that DSM false-positive reductions do not suppress true positives.

Planned fixture updates:

- Add DSM fixtures for guarded + sanitized patterns (should be info/warn, not fail).
- Add DSM fixtures for unguarded writes (must fail).
- Add JS/AJAX-in-PHP snippet fixtures to confirm exclusion.
- Add nonce-in-condition fixtures (same-line guard detection).
- Add bridge-code examples with explicit suppression to verify allowlist behavior.

### Minimal Fixture Plan (Short Scope)

Target: 60–70% improvement in DSM false-positive reduction with minimal, stable fixtures.

Scope constraints:

- 5 fixture categories only (no edge-case expansion).
- No changes to DSM rule logic unless a fixture exposes a clear false positive.
- Fixtures focused on fail/no-fail behavior, not perfect precision.

Fixture set (short list):

1. Unguarded write (must fail)
   - Direct `$_POST`/`$_GET` usage without guards or sanitizers.

2. Guarded + sanitized (should not fail)
   - Nonce + capability + sanitizer in same function; DSM should be info/warn.

3. Same-line nonce guard (should not fail)
   - `wp_verify_nonce( ... $_POST[...] ... )` in the condition line.

4. JS/AJAX-in-PHP exclusion (should not detect)
   - jQuery/fetch snippet inside a PHP admin view.

5. Bridge code allowlist (should suppress)
   - Known bridge file suppressed by `spo-002-superglobals-bridge`.

Acceptance criteria:

- DSM fixtures confirm unguarded writes still fail.
- Guarded + sanitized fixtures remain visible but do not fail.
- Exclusions only apply to JS/REST/HTML cases, not real PHP writes.
- Short plan achieved without expanding fixture count beyond the five categories above.

## Decision Points

- After Phase 3: If FP reduction is at least 5–10% and unguarded detection remains strong, ship Option A.
- After Phase 4: If GRA meaningfully reduces noise without performance issues, consider optional integration.
