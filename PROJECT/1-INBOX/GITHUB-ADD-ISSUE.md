Yes, developers have published open-source code for browser extensions that provide a button (via popup or toolbar icon) to create GitHub issues, input a title and description, and select a target repository from a list of configured ones.[1][2][3]

## Key Examples
- quick-add-github-issue-browser-extension by stilliard: A Chrome/Firefox extension with a browser action button that opens a form for title, body, repo/org selection, labels, and screenshot/debug info support.[2]
- github-issue-creator by ohbarye: A Chrome extension where you click the icon, pick from saved repos, enter title/body via templates, and submit.[4][1]

## Other Options
- Refined GitHub adds issue creation links within repos but lacks a global button with repo chooser.[3]
- Recent Reddit posts describe similar minimal Chrome extensions using the GitHub API for quick issue creation anywhere.[5]

These use the GitHub API and require a personal access token for authentication. You can fork the repos, customize for your workflow (e.g., React-based popup), and load as unpacked extensions in Chrome/Firefox for testing.[1]
