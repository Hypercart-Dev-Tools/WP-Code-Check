## How to Add Signatures

**For Maintainers:**

1. When a contributor comments "I have read and agree to the CLA" on their PR, add them to the Individual Contributors table
2. When a company submits a signed CCLA via email, add them to the Corporate Contributors table
3. Update the status if a CLA is revoked or expires

**Signature Methods:**
- `GitHub Comment` - Commented on PR
- `Email` - Sent signed PDF to cla@hypercart.com
- `DocuSign` - Electronic signature via DocuSign

**Status Values:**
- ✅ `Active` - CLA is valid
- ⚠️ `Pending` - Awaiting signature verification
- ❌ `Revoked` - CLA has been revoked
- 🕐 `Expired` - Corporate CLA needs renewal

## Verification

Before merging a PR, verify:

1. ✅ Contributor is listed in this file with "Active" status
2. ✅ If corporate contributor, verify employee is listed in CCLA
3. ✅ Date signed is before the PR submission date
